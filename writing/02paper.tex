\section{Brief Analysis}
The main objective of this paper is to compare the mean number of arrests between 1997 and 2002 by race and gender.

As we have seen Figure \ref{fig:graph} and the Tables, the male is more likely to commit crimes than the female regardless of race and year except for mixed-race(non-Hispanic). The largest mean number of arrests is from Black male regardless of years. The mean number of arrests increased over time for Black males whereas it decreased for the rest of the other males. The mean number of arrests has increased for females regardless of the race except for Blacks.
\section{Regression}



\input{../tables/regress_arrests_by_racegender.tex}

The sign of dependent variables indicates that Male with a positive coefficient is likely to commit crimes. Namely, it leads an increase in the mean number of arrests in 1997. In contrast, the rest induces a decrease in the mean number of arrests. The dependent variable 'Male' also partially implies the largest mean number of arrests from Blacks.

\newpage
\input{../tables/02regress_arrests_by_racegender.tex}

Unlike previous Table 3, the absolute value of all dependent variable coefficients has increased. This indicates that some of the categories such as Black male remarkably increased in the mean number of arrests in 2002 while the other categories such as Mixed race (non-Hispanic) male decreased a lot.
