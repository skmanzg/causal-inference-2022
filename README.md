# Grading

The deliverable that you turn into Canvas will be a URL linking to your GitHub repository. You will be graded based on having all of the following in your GitHub repository:

* A build script that cleans the raw dataset and prepares it for analysis
* A script that generates a plot using `ggplot` and saves it in the figures directory
* A script that generates a summary table using `kableExtra` and saves it in the tables directory
* A script that generates a regression output summary using `stargazer` and saves it in the tables directory
* A brief report written in LaTeX that summarizes the patterns that you find. Use a formal and descriptive writing style. You will be graded on a genuine attempt at analyzing the results.
